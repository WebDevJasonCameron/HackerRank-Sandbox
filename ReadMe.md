As with most of my projects, this is another repo designed to keep track of progressions and lessons learned during my progression as a software engineer.  I expect I can use many of the things I come across during this repo when I write, discuss with others, and build future projects. As such, this is why I am building yet another repo to capture  my engineer travels.  This is particularly what I have found during my interactions with HankerRank. Note: I do have previous interactions within a past repos (HackerWars) that I misplaced my learning documents.  I will be adding those to this repo when I find time.

#### Earlier today | HR Java Cert
Completed an HR Java Basic Certification test.  It was challenging. However, the challenge came from the misrepresenting compilation errors.  When I actually ran the tests they all passed.  

### Earlier today | Cognizant 
This assessment kicked me in the teeth.  The first problem was focussed on balanced brackets.  Second problem focused on using Java to grab API data. I spent all my time working on this because I felt I could complete it.  Unfortunately, it did not pass all the tests!  I have only used JS for that.  As such, I didn't give it much focus.  The final problem was quite the complicated SQL query between two tables.  I can honestly tell you that I have vague recollection on how SQL syntax works.  It is both extremely easy to read and difficult to construct (because I don't do it all the time).
