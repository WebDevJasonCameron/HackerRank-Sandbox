# Hanker Rank Sandbox

## 2022 07 15 | Video Walk Through
Added another package.  This package system will keep code organized for videos.  This code can be used for screenshots, videos, and copy/paste explanation.  

## 2022 07 13 | Organize Java 
I decided to org my file structure to include JS practice problems and other such content.  The Java structure now includes an Assessment Package while the Dailies are divided into year, week, and then day.  This should help me keep track of the challenges I'm doing.  It also gives me the ability to dive back into challenges I've already done to, hopefully, help me with future assessments.  

## 2022 07 12 | START
As with most of my projects, this is another repo designed to keep track of progressions and lessons learned during my progression as a software engineer.  I expect I can use many of the things I come across during this repo when I write, discuss with others, and build future projects. As such, this is why I am building yet another repo to capture  my engineer travels.  This is particularly what I have found during my interactions with HankerRank. Note: I do have previous interactions within a past repos (HackerWars) that I misplaced my learning documents.  I will be adding those to this repo when I find time.

#### Earlier today | HR Java Cert
Completed an HR Java Basic Certification test.  It was challenging. However, the challenge came from the misrepresenting compilation errors.  When I actually ran the tests they all passed.  

### Earlier today | Cognizant 
This assessment kicked me in the teeth.  The first problem was focussed on balanced brackets.  Second problem focused on using Java to grab API data. I spent all my time working on this because I felt I could complete it.  Unfortunately, it did not pass all the tests!  I have only used JS for that.  As such, I didn't give it much focus.  The final problem was quite the complicated SQL query between two tables.  I can honestly tell you that I have vague recollection on how SQL syntax works.  It is both extremely easy to read and difficult to construct (because I don't do it all the time).
