# Hanker Rank Sandbox

## 2022 07 26 | Playgrounds
Created playgrounds in java package.  The purpose of these playgrounds are to learn some things that I keep running into but can't fully grasp without exploring them further.  A great example of this is regular expressions (REGEX).  This was never talked about during college.  We didn't get into it during the CodeUp program either.  However, I have gone through four challenges in hackerRank with REGEX being the primary focus.  Each time I needed to look up someone else's conclusion.  This is why I'm exploring it within the playground.  Also, I don't want another repo (or re-open the titanLearningJava).  

## 2022 07 22 | Python
Well folks, we've actually added Python to this list of daily work.  I have been told I need to review the Python I did through college.  As such, I included Jupyter Notebooks under the Py dir.  I will probably open another repo just to focus on new things I have yet to work with.  Still, it is pretty cool to be able to have JS, Java, and Python all in this one sandbox!  Really cool.  

## 2022 07 21 | Continue a Challenge
Yesterday I worked on a problem in which was not able to pass all the tests.  As such, I decided to copy the files into today's folder (package).  I would like to see if I can get it to pass today.  This might be a good candidate for a future video walk through.

## 2022 07 19 | First Video 
Setting a goal to publish my first video on Monday, July 25th.  That is when the video needs to go live.  I want the video completed by July 22 (Friday). I would like to get a video out every week.  Each video will cover a coding challenge that looks interesting to me.  Some of them will be the ones I figured out on my own.  Others will be on challenges that I hadn't a clue on how to start (or finish).  I'll put the script in that week's video package.  I should have the challenge instructions, starting code, and my completed code (with comments).   

## 2022 07 15 | Video Walk Through
Added another package.  This package system will keep code organized for videos.  This code can be used for screenshots, videos, and copy/paste explanation.  

## 2022 07 13 | Organize Java 
I decided to org my file structure to include JS practice problems and other such content.  The Java structure now includes an Assessment Package while the Dailies are divided into year, week, and then day.  This should help me keep track of the challenges I'm doing.  It also gives me the ability to dive back into challenges I've already done to, hopefully, help me with future assessments.  

## 2022 07 12 | START
As with most of my projects, this is another repo designed to keep track of progressions and lessons learned during my progression as a software engineer.  I expect I can use many of the things I come across during this repo when I write, discuss with others, and build future projects. As such, this is why I am building yet another repo to capture  my engineer travels.  This is particularly what I have found during my interactions with HankerRank. Note: I do have previous interactions within a past repos (HackerWars) that I misplaced my learning documents.  I will be adding those to this repo when I find time.

#### Earlier today | HR Java Cert
Completed an HR Java Basic Certification test.  It was challenging. However, the challenge came from the misrepresenting compilation errors.  When I actually ran the tests they all passed.  

### Earlier today | Cognizant 
This assessment kicked me in the teeth.  The first problem was focussed on balanced brackets.  Second problem focused on using Java to grab API data. I spent all my time working on this because I felt I could complete it.  Unfortunately, it did not pass all the tests!  I have only used JS for that.  As such, I didn't give it much focus.  The final problem was quite the complicated SQL query between two tables.  I can honestly tell you that I have vague recollection on how SQL syntax works.  It is both extremely easy to read and difficult to construct (because I don't do it all the time).
