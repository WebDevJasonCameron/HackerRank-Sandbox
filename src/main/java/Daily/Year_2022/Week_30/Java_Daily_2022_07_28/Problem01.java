/**
 *      Problem 01
 *
 *      Java's BigDecimal class can handle arbitrary-precision signed
 *      decimal numbers. Let's test your knowledge of them!
 *
 *      Given an array, s, of n real number strings, sort them in descending
 *      order â€” but wait, there's more! Each number must be printed in the
 *      exact same format as it was read from stdin, meaning that .1 is printed
 *      as .1, and 0.1 is printed as 0.1. If two numbers represent numerically
 *      equivalent values (e.g., .1 == 0.1), then they must be listed in the
 *      same order as they were received as input).
 *
 *      Complete the code in the unlocked section of the editor below. You
 *      must rearrange array s's elements according to the instructions above.
 *
 *  Input Format
 *
 *      The first line consists of a single integer, n, denoting the number of
 *      integer strings.
 *      Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a real number denoting
 *      the value of s.
 *
 * Constraints
 *      - 1 <= n <= 200
 *      - Each s(lower i) has at most 300 digits.
 *
 *  Output Format
 *      Locked stub code in the editor will print the contents of array  to stdout.
 *      You are only responsible for reordering the array's elements.
 *
